		 * This test will complete the following objectives:  Test all of the sensor agent functionality LOCAL to the agent so that we can see that the sensor agents work
		 * How this test will work:
		 * A.  Three instances of the sensor agent will be be used: entry, popup, and exit along with a transducer
		 * B.  Mocks to be used: Conveyor, ConveyorFamily, PopUp, Animation
		 * C.  A transducer will be used to simulate the animation events for the sensors
		 * D.  Outline:
		 * 	1.  Entry Sensor Test:

		 * 		b.  Send the glass from a previous conveyor family (test code) to the entry sensor
		 * 		c.  Test the following postconditions:  Entry sensor has a glass with state justEntered, Mock Conveyor Has no glass
		 * 		d.  Run sensor scheduler
		 * 		e.  Test postconditions: Entry sensor still has glass with the Yes onSensor state, Mock Conveyor Has glass, GUI conveyor should have been turned on in MockAnimation
		 * 		f.  Have transducer call that glass has left sensor
		 * 		g.  Check postconditions:  Entry sensor still has glass with changed state, Mock Conveyor Has glass
		 * 		h.  Run scheduler
		 * 		i.  Check postconditions:  Entry sensor has no glass, Mock Conveyor Has glass, Mock Conveyor Family received positionFree msg()
		 * 
		 * 	2.  PopUp Sensor Test:
		 * 		a.  Test the following preconditions:  PopUp sensor has no glass, Mock Conveyor Has glass
		 * 		b.  Have transducer send a message to this sensor agent that glass has hit GUI popUp sensor
		 * 		c.  Test the following postconditions:  PopUp sensor has a glass with state justEntered, Mock Conveyor Has glass
		 * 		d.  Run sensor scheduler
		 * 		e.  Test postconditions: PopUp sensor still has glass with the Yes onSensor state, Mock Conveyor Has glass with updated state, GUI conveyor should still be turned on in MockAnimation
		 * 		f.  Have transducer call that glass has left sensor
